# Description
I am currently a 17 year-old high school student. As of now, I am taking classes at Raritan Valley Community college, one of them being a web development class (can you guess why this project was made?). This website is a product of several weeks of class lessons culminating in one final project. Throughout each week, our professor introduced to us new skills and concepts that we could then implement into our website. This method acted as a sort of "evolution" as each week our websites would progressively get more and more developed. We learned a wide variety of HTML and CSS functions, and these include:
 - Responsive design
 - Animations and transitions
 - Color schemes
 - Embedded media
 - And various other intricate details about HTML and CSS
 # Color Scheme
 The color scheme I used for this website is very basic. It involves three colors that I believe work very well with each other:
