        <h2>Who am I?</h2>

        <p>
            I am currently a 17 year-old high school student. As of now, I am taking classes at Raritan Valley Community college, one of them being a web development class (can you guess why this project was made?). This website is a product of several weeks of class lessons culminating in one final project. While it may not be the best, it sure is mine! That;s enough academic talk, let's get to me. Some interests I share are... 
        </p>
        
            <li>Cooking! Both of my parents have worked in kitchens before, so I've been learning from them for quite a long time. For my age, I'd say I know my way around the kitchen pretty well.</li>
            <li>Weightlifting. Whether it be going for strength and trying to lift some heavy weight, or going for muscle gain and trying to get as big as possible, I LOVE the gym. I am in there at least 12 hours a week, it's my favorite!</li>
            <li>Spending quality time with those I care about (how cliche). On a serious note, my favorite memories all involve either my family or people I would call my family, regardless of relation. Life just isn't the same without them.</li>

        <p>
            I hope that has given you some initial insight on myself. If you'd like to see more, keep scrolling! Below are some images, videos, and other informatuon regarding me. Thanks for stopping by! If you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to contact me. Enjoy your stay!

            <h2>
                The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes
            </h2>

            <div>
                <p>"Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction."</p>
                <p>"And how did you verify them?"</p>
                <p>"Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed description. I eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise--the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employé, James Windibank. Voilà tout!"</p>
                <p>"And Miss Sutherland?"</p>
                <p>"If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old Persian saying, 'There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.' There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world."</p>
