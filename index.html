        <h2>Who am I?</h2>

        <p>
            I am currently a 17 year-old high school student. As of now, I am taking classes at Raritan Valley Community college, one of them being a web development class (can you guess why this project was made?). This website is a product of several weeks of class lessons culminating in one final project. While it may not be the best, it sure is mine! That's enough academic talk, let's get to me. Some interests I share are... 
        </p>
        
            <li>Cooking! Both of my parents have worked in kitchens before, so I've been learning from them for quite a long time. For my age, I'd say I know my way around the kitchen pretty well.</li>
            <li>Weightlifting. Whether it be going for strength and trying to lift some heavy weight, or going for muscle gain and trying to get as big as possible, I LOVE the gym. I am in there at least 12 hours a week, it's my favorite!</li>
            <li>Spending quality time with those I care about (how cliche). On a serious note, my favorite memories all involve either my family or people I would call my family, regardless of relation. Life just isn't the same without them.</li>

        <p>
            I hope that has given you some initial insight on myself. If you'd like to see more, keep scrolling! Below are some images, videos, and other informatuon regarding me. Thanks for stopping by! If you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to contact me. Enjoy your stay!

            <h2>
                Image Hover Effects 
            </h2>

            <div>
                <p>Image hover effects are a great way to add some interactivity to your website. When a user hovers their cursor over an image, the image can change in a number of ways to create a neat visual effect. In this article, we'll explore some of the different ways you can create image hover effects in HTML.</p>
                <p>One of the most common image hover effects is to have the image change color when the cursor hovers over it. This can be achieved using CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is a stylesheet language that is used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. By using CSS, you can specify the color of an image when it is hovered over, as well as other styles such as the size, position, and border of the image.</p>
                <p>Another popular image hover effect is to have the image change to a different image when the cursor hovers over it. This is called an image swap, and it can be achieved using a combination of HTML and CSS. In HTML, you can use the IMG tag to insert an image into your webpage. The IMG tag has an attribute called src, which stands for source, and this attribute specifies the URL of the image that you want to display. By using the :hover pseudo-class in CSS, you can specify a different src attribute for the image when it is hovered over. This way, when the cursor hovers over the image, the image will change to the new specified image.</p>
                <p>Another type of image hover effect is to have the image grow or shrink in size when the cursor hovers over it. This effect is called a zoom effect, and it can be achieved using CSS transforms. CSS transforms allow you to modify the appearance of an element by scaling, rotating, skewing, or translating it. By using the scale() function in CSS, you can specify the amount by which an element should be scaled. By combining the :hover pseudo-class with the scale() function, you can create a zoom effect where the image grows or shrinks in size when the cursor hovers over it.</p>
                <p>In addition to the above effects, there are many other ways you can create image hover effects in HTML. You can use CSS animations to create smooth transitions between the different states of an image, or you can use CSS filters to apply visual effects such as blurring or grayscaling to an image. You can also use JavaScript to create more complex image hover effects, such as pop-ups or lightboxes that display additional information or a larger version of the image when the cursor hovers over it.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, image hover effects are a great way to add some interactivity and visual interest to your website. By using CSS, you can create a variety of different image hover effects, such as color changes, image swaps, zoom effects, and more. With a little creativity and experimentation, you can create some truly impressive image hover effects that will make your website stand out and engage your visitors.</p>
